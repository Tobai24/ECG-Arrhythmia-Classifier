### ðŸ“Š Dataset Overview

#### About the Dataset

This project uses a dataset sourced from Kaggle, which focuses on ECG signal features for arrhythmia classification. The original dataset was derived from the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Dataset hosted on PhysioNet. It contains features extracted from two-lead ECG signals (lead II and lead V5), focusing on detecting cardiac arrhythmias. The dataset includes programmatically extracted features critical for distinguishing regular and irregular heartbeats.

#### ðŸ”— Dataset Sources

The dataset includes features from four ECG arrhythmia datasets:

1. MIT-BIH Supraventricular Arrhythmia Database
2. MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database
3. St. Petersburg INCART 12-lead Arrhythmia Database
4. Sudden Cardiac Death Holter Database

> **Original PhysioNet Dataset**: [MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Dataset](https://physionet.org/content/mitdb/1.0.0/)

#### ðŸŽ¯ Target Column

The `type` column classifies heartbeats into:

- **N**: Normal beats
- **S**: Supraventricular ectopic beats
- **V**: Ventricular ectopic beats
- **F**: Fusion beats
- **Q**: Unknown beats
